				<p class="text" id="itl-text">
					Over the summer, I worked as a research assistant at Inclusive Technology Lab. 
					I worked on the front-end development of a dyslexic-friendly text editor. For many spell-checkers,
					multiple suggestions for misspelled words look very similar to individuals with dyslexia. To combat this,
					we created multi-modal representations of the spelling suggestions in order to offer a visual stimulus related
					to the definition of the word. In this way, each spelling suggestion is distinguishable.
					We also worked with text-to-speech features to facilitate proofreading.

					This year, I am completing a team project for the IEEE Northwestern Spring Showcase. Our project is a web app
					that facilitates the navigation of Northwestern's courses and classrooms. Northwestern's current system for finding
					classes to take is very difficult to navigate and not very visually accommodating. Student's aren't sure what kind of prerequisites
					a class has, if it counts for their major, where to find information on the class, etc. We wanted to create something that
					facilitates this process. We are building a webapp where students can make an account and enter in their information and classes
					they've aleady taken. Using the Northwestern API, we can match this profile with potential classes that have the information
					presented in a clean way.

					I worked in a team to develop an "inhaler starter kit" for young children with asthma that helps them use metered-dose inhalers 
					properly and efficiently. Our initial problem was that many young children didn't know how to correctly administer the medicine
					in their inhaler - our design includes button-activated voice instructions and an easy-to-follow instructional children's picture book.
					During our research, we also found that many parents often misplace supplementary components of the inhaler or would not carry them around
					because there were too many parts. Our design features a fit spot for another medicine canister and for a spacer, so that all of the
					components are conveniently packaged together.

					I worked in a team to design and 3D-print an electromechanical device that helps students with cerebral palsy safely navigate up 
					the stairs. Many students with cerebral palsy, including our subject of study, would often misjudge the height of the stairs and 
					hit it with his foot on the way up. We wanted to create a theraputic device that would provide audio feedback when a stair was hit,
					thus training them to anticipate the height of the stairs. The design would fit snugly on top of a sneaker.
					This device was run by a battery-powered arduino and gave off a beeping sound when a stair was hit.

				<p class="text" id="kendama-text">
					I designed a t-shirt inspired by the kendama, a traditional Japanese skill toy that has since become popular in America. 
					I wanted to include a minimalist landscape of Japanese mountains, but also incorporate modern themes by adding stars 
					and a color scheme vaguely resembling a galaxy.
					This was designed with watercolor, colored pencil, and ink on physical paper, then scanned and created into a shirt design on Photoshop.

					I designed a t-shirt inspired by the song "Goodbye To A World" by Porter Robinson. The design features the lyrics, which repeat over and over again 
					throughout the song. I created a uniform, grid background with pixel-style text. The main feature of the design is the iconic "Shelter" icon from the same musical artist. 
					This was designed on Adobe Illustrator and digitally printed on shirts.</p>
